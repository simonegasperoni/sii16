030dddc8-a34d-4fb5-8006-388851623082	Motherboards	ASUS Maximus VIII Gene & Noctua NH-D15S	I didn't realize that the Noctua NH-D15S actually overhangs the first graphics card slot on the ASUS Maximus VIII Gene. I am only running a single GTX 970 so at first it seemed I was ok. But then I noticed that the two PCIe slots are not the same, the first is a x16/x8 slot but the second is only x8. Will that affect the graphics performance? I am also using a Samsung 950 M.2 SSD if that's relevant.

The first AsRock on the list does have USB 3.1, however, I don't have any devices that would use it. Thank you for any input.

21f2f4e9-2858-4fb2-990c-7efca402294e	Motherboards	Which AMD board with proven IOMMU working ?	Hi I whish to build an machine to use as NAS, TV Tuner and Game Machine at the same time. The GFX Board, Tuner Cards and USB controller should be passed to their respective VMs via IOMMU Everything would under ESXi as hypervisor. I have read a lot about AMD AM3+ and FX2 motherboards but I have still not found the perfect one. I would need: 3 PCIe slots 2 PCI Slots At least 3 USB 3.0 ports Support for 32GB RAM One of the PCIe ports would be occupied by IBM 1055 SAS/SATA controller. 2 PCI slots will have a SAT TV and DIGITAL DVBT boards. The remaining PCIe Slots would a one or 2 GFX Boards CPU power consumption is important to me. I still have not choosen the processor. a 65w TDP one would be good but also a 95w TDP would be usable. Nothing more that this value. Which motherboard would you suggest which has less problems with iommu and ESXi 6.x ? Regards, Giuseppe Chillemi

f6bd281f-5a12-4f20-8981-021f878c9e1c	Motherboards	GA-X99-SLI XMP Fail	So I have a build I'm doing with all brand new parts, and after switching from dual 390X crossfire (too hot) to GTX 980s in SLI, the board now crashes consistently on boot with XMP enabled. It was working just fine previously, the crashes only started happening after swapping the GPUs. As far as I can tell, I'm having the exact same issue as these guys: X99 SLI Gigabyte X99 boards - RAM sensitivity? - Overclockers UK Forums Here are the specs of the system: i7 5820K Corsair H100i Gigabyte GA-X99-SLI 32GB (4x8GB) Gskill Ripjaws V DDR4 2400 2x EVGA GTX 980 Samsung 850 Pro 256GB WD Blue 4TB EVGA Supernova 1000P Thermaltake Level 10 GT Windows 10 64 Updated the BIOS to the latest version, no change. I tried swapping the Gskill kit out for a tested working Crucial Ballistix kit with the same specs (4x8GB DDR4 2400), no change. After every crash / failed boot, the system will then POST with the 'boot failure detected' error. If I go into BIOS and then exit without saving, Windows will then load. What's odd is that memtest and Prime95 are completely stable, no errors. I'm completely baffled as to why this would start happening after changing out the video cards - I didn't touch the memory at all during the swap, and it worked flawlessly with XMP enabled previously. Any ideas?  
874409e9-7a06-47ac-b547-a43b9897918d	Motherboards	Z87E-ITX / Intel USB XHCI Issues	I seem to be having a run of bad luck with obscure and difficult to diagnose problems lately. This one has been particularly frustrating. Here's the story: I built a PC with the following specs: i7 4770k ASRock Z87E-ITX Corsair H80 Kingston HyperX Fury 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3 1866 RAM Samsung 850 Pro 256GB SSD WD Green 4TB Silverstone Strider ST50F-ESG 500W Gold PSU Corsair Graphite 380T Chassis I installed Win7 Pro 64, then upgraded to Win10 Pro 64. Never had any issues with it, everything worked great. Sold it to a guy locally, and it worked fine for a few days, then randomly decided to stop recognizing all the USB ports (both 2.0 and 3.0). All the USB devices still work fine in BIOS (KB, Mouse, Flash Drive), so I figured it must be something on the software side. I opened up device manager and I find that the 'USB xHCI Compliant Host Controller' is reporting that 'This device cannot start (Code 10).' Some googling shows that lots of other people have encountered this same issue, but concrete solutions are lacking. The only suggestion that seems to have worked for some people is to uninstall all the USB devices and let Windows reinstall them. I tried that to no avail, though in a single instance (dozens of attempts to repro failed) disabling the xHCI controller and then re-enabling it caused everything to suddenly detect and work again magically - until restart, then back to square one. I've looked around, but cannot find any drivers from either Asrock or Intel to try in lieu of the Win10 default (the most recent is for Win7 only and refuses to install in Win10). Trying to automatically update simply tells me I already have the best driver installed. I went so far as to do a complete reset of Win10, which did not solve the problem. I then reinstalled Win7, and all the USB ports started working again using the default drivers - then I installed the aforementioned driver from the Asrock website, which caused the same 'device cannot start' error to start happening again. Uninstalling the driver makes everything work once more, though it leaves an unidentified item in device manager that doesn't seem to affect anything. Results are the same with the driver downloaded from Intel, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same driver. I saved an image of the Win7 install with everything functional (IE, not using the asrock/intel driver) in case I need to go back to it, then went through the Win10 upgrade process once more. No joy, problem came back immediately. Other notes: * BIOS is updated to the latest version. * Enabling the USB Compatibility Patch option in BIOS or disabling Legacy USB support does not solve the problem, but cause the BIOS to stop recognizing all USB devices (even with the UEFI Setup option that is supposed to retain USB support in BIOS), and then I have to do a CMOS clear to get back in. TLDR: USB ports were working in fine in Win10, suddenly stopped and xHCI controller no longer starts. Can't find any updated or alternate Win10 drivers to use. USB ports are physically fine, everything works in BIOS and Win7 (as long as I don't change any of the Legacy Support or USB Compatibility options in BIOS, or install the updated driver available for Win7, which breaks it in the same way as Win10). I'm hoping someone with a deeper understanding of all this stuff has heard of / encountered this issue before and can point me in the right direction.  
c0e0a25e-721e-4353-9a7e-1e3ede2dfb45	Motherboards	Gigabyte motherboards are outdated compared to Asus	I upgraded from 3770k to 6700k and decided to try another mobo manufacturer. I fell in love with Gigabyte Gaming G1 since it's beautiful, has support for water cooling and even have integrated Sound Blaster ZxR (a €200 sound card!). It's the best and most expensive 1151 motherboard Gigabyte has to offer. Before that I had Asus Maximus V Extreme, which back in the day was the best and most expensive 1155 motherboard Asus had to offer. The problems I have with Gigabyte Gaming G1: 1) To be able to reset BIOS, you have to short a jumper. Which feels so 2002. And also, it's so badly placed and covered by my second video card so I have to remove it every time I want to reset BIOS. Asus: Has a reset button in the I/O side. VERY handy! 2) The above problem would not be such a big issue if BIOS would not just hang up if I go too low voltage for the overclock (ocing to 4.7ghz at 1.300v would for some unknown reason hang up the whole BIOS). There was no way to fix it but force reset BIOS. 3) BIOS hangs up randomly both in BIOS and after reporting unsuccessful overclocks. What's up with that? It is not however as bad hang up as just going low voltage, it can still boot but I need to swap USB ports on my keyboard since it won't respond. 4) Compared to Asus, Gigabyte have really confusing and weird laid out BIOS menu. 4) Prior to upgrading to integrated ZxR, I had a PCI-E ZxR card. For some reason, the interface in the integrated one is different, very confusing and doesn't offer as many options as the PCI-E one. It is the same sound card. Because of that I am unable to simply use the software to switch between headphones and home cinema system. I have to go to playback options in Windows and change devices. Besides the jumper problem, the rest is more of a software issue. However I don't see Gigabyte fixing them anytime soon. Probably not ever. I do regret not buying Asus motherboard, but still, I don't want to complain much since this motherboard is doing its job well, but for a €550 motherboard I expected more. I do like it's WIFI antenna though! Really sweet and is magnetic. But I'm an overclocker, I got spoiled by Asus who actually does a great job when it comes to overclocking and gives attention to detail. Those who worked with Asus and that BIOS reset button know what I'm talking about.

ca79986f-933e-48e8-90df-c825d4fcdb5c	Motherboards	Possible to put a 16x PCIe (Sapphire 5450) in a 1x PCIe slot?	Ive read about it being possible if the slot is notched out to allow the larger card to fit. It sounds like the 1x slot on the motherboard can only provide 10watts though (rather than 25watts for a 16x slot). Its a MS7500 mobo in a SFF case, and the GPU is a Sapphire 5450 DDR3 1GB. Was thinking of doing this because the position of the 16x slot is poorly located at the far edge of the case where there is no cooling or airspace and the card overheats there, whereas the 1x slot is directly in the airflow stream from the cpu/case fan (in a SFF case). The PC won't be used for heavy gaming, just multi monitor (at 1280x1024), online, movies, and very light gaming.

So the question. This is an Asus P8p67 Deluxe and I have never updated the Marvel firmware or bios on this board. Has anyone done that and is there any chance I might get better writes?

9464073b-ffcd-4f8a-89da-b9f04f1ec7aa	Motherboards	Desperate need HELP, MB breakes every 6 months!	Hey guys, I am desperate for some idea of what is going on, I have built my machines since the 90s, I know most of it, but I am not an expert by any means, just someone that likes to build my own. My issue: My motherboard breaks after 6 months, 3 times. I have replaced the mb twice already, I am now on my 3rd time it stops working. The issue is after a while it wont boot anymore and it goes thru multiple fases of erro codes. Most commonly starts at code 79, it wont boot at all, then I swap to the other bios and it works for a while and starts to fail again. The code changes from 79 to 04, sometimes stuck at 68, some times 33, I've seen 55 and I've seen it being stuck at one code but quickly swap to a number I can see, because its very fast. Lastly after a couple weeks it wont boot at all, no matter what I do. Reset the bios, remove the battery, replaced all the hardware I can to see it anything else fails. the only piece of hardware I am not able to swap is the memory for not having more of it. Its driving me insane, I have replace the MB twice, CPU once and the Power supply I got a new one right after the 1st one broke. It works fine for 6 months like I said, but then it breaks. I'm starting to think something else is causing a short circuit or something. Could the Memory be doing this? could the case be doing this? Power strip? any ideas PLEASE!

5f7da4c9-fc46-4d22-b8c0-9fe2c178a88a	Motherboards	Maximus VI Impact Sparks from VRM daughterboard module	I have had this motherboard since an RMA in June 2015 Got out of watercooling and overclocking when I RMA'ed the board last time (can find my For sale thread). Using intel stock cooler and stock bios settings. System contains 4770k, 750ti, 8gb trident X ram, silverstone SFX 450w psu. March 2016 System shut off when I was idling on desktop. When I tried to turn it on, it did not budge, not even QCODE. When I UNPLUGGED the CPU power header, it was able to get to 00 QCODE (no CPU) which is expected. Then I plugged the CPU power in again to try to turn it on, sparks came from the VRM daughterboard. Again, this is on stock bios setting, no extra voltage or anything. I powered off the PSU immediately and disassembled the system and took photos of the VRM area. I also inspected the cpu socket and there are NO BENT PINS. I am not sure what the components are called between the caps (pink) and the chokes(blocky) but the first and the third set is blackened. second set is how it should look. The whole VRM contains about 8 sets of these things, this picture only shows 3. This picture shows the thermal pads on the VRM heatsink. It has also been charred by he sparks. I contacted ASUS two days ago (by phone) and they gave me the run around (someone will contact you within 48 hours etc etc). No one did. I contacted them today again (by chat) today and the rep said was able to start the RMA for me but I have yet to receive any shipping instructions or label.(EDIT: got RMA form and shipping label) Both reps also quoted that "if there is damage on the board the RMA will be refused". Reading many nightmare stories of ASUS RMA saying its customer induced damage and sending back the same board back (multiple times) isn't comforting either. Its also funny the rep suggested that he wants to know if I can post the board after the sparks happened (im guessing it might? but I dont wanna risk my other components) Can some one from ASUS assist?

e1c92a4a-0c35-4d9b-8d26-4c7ddea2a99d	Motherboards	Anybody here still have a Abit board?	Weird thing happened, Uguru lost my hour count and I don't understand how. At first I thought it was the urugu program but that just relays what's in bios. I reinstalled it just to make sure, nothing changed. I had roughly 65533 hours last check, it reset to zero. No corruption, board is still rock solid. Kinda sucks, like having your odometer roll back when you are about to hit 300K miles. Seems petty but it was a cool feature to keep tabs on all the stats. Not sure if flashing the bios resets it as I never have, still using the original from 2007.

6e273012-d71a-476b-a366-272fc6281c60	Motherboards	P3608 wont detect in RSTe on MSI X99S GAMING 9 AC	Hey Everyone, I have an MSI X99S Gaming 9 AC motherboard with an Intel P3608 PCIE NVME drive. The 3608 is technically two 800GB Intel 750 series drives on the same board and requires a RAID 0 setup in order to get the full performance and capacity out of the single drive. In order to do this "correctly", I need to be able to use the Intel RSTe (Enterprise version of Intel Rapid Storage) to set up the array. While the RSTe program loads up fine, it doesnt detect any of the drives in the system other than my BLU-RAY drive. Having said this, as I eluded to earlier, all drives detect correctly in Disk Management. I have the latest BIOS installed with the updated ME drivers installed as well. If I do the raid via Disk Management, I lose the ability to trim the drive which is obviously not good. I normally use ASUS motherboards but none of the X99 ASUS boards were out when I built the system. I have always been able to find BIOS's where users patched in the ability to use the Enterprise Intel controller software, but not that I *really* need it (from what I can tell) I have gotten ZERO responses from the MSI forums, so figured I would see if anyone here has run into this before and has any ideas for me to try. Thanks!

689055a6-717b-408b-be0d-ecc3bca23245	Motherboards	Asus Maximus VIII Gene sound issue	I haven't been able to find anyone with a similar issue, so I figured I'd ask: Does anyone have issues using stereo sound from the S/PDIF optical port on an Asus Maximus VIII Gene (or not Gene) board? I am currently using the S/PDIF output to an external DAC->headamp->power amp setup, and while music comes through just fine, when playing games I am missing any sounds that take place behind the "camera." This may have been going on for a while as I mostly play EVE Online and don't usually pay much attention to the sound, but when playing Metro: 2033 or Fallout 4 it is very noticeable. Windows is setup to output stereo sound to the digital output, and the Asus SonicStudio whatever software is also setup to do so, yet it seems like it's trying to output surround and my headphones are only getting the front speaker output. Trying to play Dying Light a few days ago was very frustrating as I could not hear any zombies that were behind me. The ones in front sounded great, but anything behind me just ceased to make noise. A temporary fix has been to use the analog output directly to the headamp, though this introduces hissing and other undesirable effects. DAC is still working fine with an older PC and its optical out, so the issue is somewhere with the Asus board/software/drivers. I'm not sure when the issue started. I'm using the latest drivers available from the Asus website.  
d3f7d2c9-b4ae-4ccd-a222-69087b59aed2	Motherboards	Which manufacturer has the most straighforward OC (z170)?	hello everyone, from your experience which one of MSI, ASUS, Gigabyte, Asrock offers the easiest/most straightforward/least tweaking necessary OC experience. I don't want to use the phrase "out of the box" but I am looking for something close to it. I am not interested in the auto OC tuners (those are typically quite bad) but the manual settings needed to tweak to reach a good OC (without feeding the CPU too much vcore voltage) on a 6600k or 6700k and some fast(ish) RAM (around 3200 Mhz). Not interested in extreme OCs so I am not looking at the highest end boards. Would like to keep it under 200 EUR but if any I have an Asus P8P67-m pro with a 2500k at the moment and after a few years of stable OC it started acting up so I had to reconfigure it and it's a pain in the ass to get it right.

As of 6/1/2012, I have received both refunds, and my Newegg account suspension was lifted once I canceled the Paypal disputes. While this doesn't make the shady practices allegedly occurring at Newegg any better, it at least resolves my specific issue. I will no longer be shopping at Newegg.com as a result of this entire situation, and feel lucky that I got out of this mess with my money. What a demoralizing experience. I realize the post subject may be inflammatory to some, but I swear that this is what is happening. Some background: First, on April 15th, I received an Asus P8Z68-V/Gen3 board that would work great until installed a GTX580 of any type. Tried three different 580s, no video. A 560ti, 7970 and numerous other smaller cards would all work great. Took the board out, checked to be sure there was no damage to the CPU socket, carefully placed the plastic socket cover back on and started the "RMA for replacement" process with Newegg. Long story short, they denied the RMA stated "customer-caused damage to CPU pins". I received the board back and literally 1/4 of the pins in the CPU socket were completely smashed. No way in the world that I caused this damage. While waiting on the first RMA, on April 25th, I ordered an ASRock P67 EXTREME4 GEN3 motherboard to replace the Asus board, thinking I'd put the Asus board in another build when it was returned. Received the ASRock board and while the packaging was nice, I wasn't pleased with the board quality. Again, started the RMA process, and didn't even remove the plastic CPU socket cover on this one. Just received notification today that my ASRock board RMA has been denied due to "Customer-caused damage to CPU pins". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THIS BOARD WAS NEVER EVEN IN MY COMPUTER, NEWEGG. All I can think is that the techs over there are intentionally damaging returned motherboards to avoid paying out the refund. I've literally begged their customer service reps to give me an avenue to pursue this with their management. I've pulled my hair out. I've started PayPal disputes on both transactions...but have a feeling that will go absolutely nowhere. I realize that I'm just kind of yelling into the wind here, but I had to vent somewhere. I've used Newegg for a long time, and built computers for even longer...and I know good and damn well when I've done something stupid and bent pins. This is definitely not one (or two) of those times. My mind is absolutely blown.

The issue I'm having is that the m.2 slot operates at 10gb/sec speed and not full 4x / 32gb/sec speed. So I was wondering if I can just buy an adapter and use the Samsung 850 pro drive in a PCIE slot instead? I've read online that this motherboards' 3rd pcie slot is tied to the m.2 slot and may not operate at full speed. Thoughts? Thanks in advance! EDIT: Meant for title to state 950 pro

My wife's grandmother wanted me to take a look at hers. She said it had been sluggish for a while. I haven't booted it yet, but noticed the PCH doesnt have a heatsink on it. I've not seen this before. Its a Dell Inspiron 660s Model D06S. Has a Pentium G2030 in it. If you would like more details, the Express swrvice tag# is 16469903629. Shouldn't the PCH have a heatsink?

6abcf93e-871d-4e50-a0f7-3f890f3a5586	Motherboards	Sabertooth Z170 Mark1 ram and cpu overclocking	Have: ASUS Sabertooth Z170 Mark1 Motherboard i7-6700k 32GB G.Skill (2x16GB) 3200MHz 15-15-15-35 DDR4 RAM As mentioned by Dan in the review for this board, I can't enable X.M.P with the most recent bios version and get the system to post with my current FSP HydroG 750W PSU, (see below how I was able to with my old Ultra PSU). It beeps four times and when restarted gives the "overclocking failure re-enter settings in bios error). Trying to figure a workaround to OC my RAM. Is it safe to manually lower the latency as far as it will go and still post and boot into windows? Or is there some limit that I should stop at to keep it from damaging the RAM? (Or is that limit simply windows doesn't work well or it won't post?) I manually changed RAM voltage to 1.35V and the timing to 14-14-34@3000 and it posted, booted and loaded into windows fine. Is it safe to go over the 1.35V (X.M.P. settings specified by G.Skill) for RAM or can that damage the RAM? *PSU story: when I first build system had an Ultra X4 750W modular PSU and when enabling X.M.P. in the bios the board came with (version 1101 - 23Oct2015) it posted, booted and loaded into Windows just fine. After using the computer though I noticed that only about 1 in 10 times would it restart or shut down properly with X.M.P. enabled and about 6 out of 10 times at stock settings, X.M.P. not enabled. I then updated to the lastest version of bios (version 1602) and enabled X.M.P. The system WILL NOT POST and gives the error. So I replaced the PSU with the HydroG one mentioned above and now can'y enable X.M.P. at all (with any bios version). However at stock settings and the 3000MHz setting I mentioned above it seems to restart and shutdown properly 10 out of 10 times.  
0cff566d-bcb5-4986-9158-d7843eba5fb9	Motherboards	Dear Motherboard Manufacturers: Make OROMS Easier to Upgrade	Currently have an X58 Rampage III Gene. Yeah, I know it's a little old but there's plenty of people here who know X58 boards still have a large fanbase. One of the problems I've run into on this board and newer is that when the manufacturers of onboard components come up with better firmware, it's nigh impossible to get a BIOS/UEFI update with it. Examples off the top of my head: - RAID OROMs - Ethernet firmware - Audio chip upgrades (stop using custom VIA drivers!) Especially on enthusiast boards, you're already giving us features that will let us physically fry the crap out of them, so "safety of the consumer experience" is not an excuse. Thank you! - This dude

I have: MSI PC Mate Z170A motherboard 16GB (2x8) G.Skill TridentZ 3200 Intel i5 6600k Gigabyte GeForce 960 G1-Gaming 4GB These are the components I have so far, enough to get me into the BIOS to play around. I hooked it up to my TV via HDMI and also tried an older Dual Link DVI monitor. The BIOS is only in black and white. All the videos on youtube I have watched show this particular BIOS in color. Is this because I don't have an OS and installed graphics drivers? Also, I have the TV or monitor plugged into the graphics card, not the motherboard. I tried the motherboard and it wouldn't work. Thanks for any help

It finally came back today, completely unfixed! I had the B2 stepping south bridge problem, so my first 4 sata ports were unusable. I'm still under warranty, so I thought, "Hey, let's send it in and just get it fixed." Well, whatever. Just got off the phone with their RMA support, and they told me that they didn't know why it wasn't fixed, but that if they still had my board in stock, they'd send a new one out, but if they didn't, then I'd have to send mine in for a completely new RMA. Gah!! Such a fun time. Just wanted to complain a little bit. Hope you guys have had better luck with ASUS than I have.

112b038d-2ae5-42e8-8097-c626949a5f81	Motherboards	Asus Z97-A/USB 3.1 Surge protection kicked in	Really dumb question, but I was plugging in my Corsair KZ0 keyboard which uses a two prong USB cable. The first cable went in fine and the second cable I started to put in backwards. At that point the surge protection kicked in and restarted. Everything else has been ok since then but I am concerned that I may have screwed things up. Two other things to note, this was in the 3.1 port and the IO shield isn't on my case (Fractal R5). I may have slipped and it the sides when I was plugging it in too.

The AsRock is a great board overall. First bootup with only small issue: doesn't recognize DEL keystrokes to enter bios using a USB keyboard, plug my PS2 key in and update the BIOS online directly from inside the BIOS, problem solved, great feature. Has the X OC socket with extra pins. Currently running a mild OC @ 4.2Ghz with 1.150v core, 1.8v input, 1.0v uncore/cache @ 3.3Ghz. Passed all stress include Prime AVX2/FM3 with max temp of 83C. Zero issues so far. This is one of the best motherboard I've ever had (first AsRock) considering I've used 815, 845PE, KT400, 865PE, nForce 3&4, P965, P35, P45, P55, P67, Z87 and now, X99. Only 2 other boards that satisfied me after the first few days of use are the Z87-A and the P45-UD3P. 4.4Ghz is stable with Prime95 non-AVX, realbench (4 hours), AIDA (8 hours). Max temp 81C but seems like 4.2 is the sweet spot for my setup. Best part is VRM doesn't get hotter than 72C even at 4.4Ghz (measured with infrared thermometer gun).

I have Windows 10 running with everything updated. I played a few steam games last night and everything was working great. I decided to try the 5 way optimization from the AI Suite 3 and ever since then, it won't boot anymore or show Windows. After I pressed the 5 way optimization button, there was a message that said the computer might restart a couple times during the process. After it restarted, it came back on and the fans are extremely loud now. Nothing comes up on my display. Blank screen, loud fans. I've tried restarting. Tired unplugging and plugging back in. Even tried unplugging and pressing the power button to drain capacitors. Still, nothing. Blank screen, loud fans. Sometimes when I restart the code is A9 and others A0. Please help!!!! I have no idea what to do. Thanks

I've done a bit of searching over the last couple days, but I can't seem to find any of these for sale at a reasonable price, brand new. My R4E is starting to have headers die on it, namely some fans and the USB3 header is damaged leading to 1 port not working at all (even noted in device manager). Yesterday my CPU fan header apparently died, killing fan connectors on my Kraken x61 also. I'm using the CPU optional header now with all fans on the GPU kraken, which has slowed it down (the Kraken that is). So i was thinking of getting this board, but what a wild hunt. Anyone know any place that will ship to Australia that might have this and not for $850? Thought i'd try my luck on here anyway. Cheers.

4b098542-21a6-4269-bd9b-d56bb5d1cac8	Motherboards	USB Ports not working.	Ok, so this is really ticking me off... There is a serious problem with my usb ports. They stop working after a while. I've tried everything: Reinstalling the drivers, turning off power saving mode, but nothing is working. I started noticing it after my usb game controllers would stop working during or after use while they were still plugged in. I wo uld then try transferring data via usb sticks or connecting my phone and they were definitely not working at all. My mouse and keyboard work consistently but there are those rare times where they do not power on during boot up and I have to switch them over to other usb ports for them to get working again. I recently started using a usb hub that is plugged in to the back usb ports, which have fewer problems, but even that has started having the same problems. My specs are in the sig and hopefully someone knows what to do.  
e9b92196-5f86-4de7-8147-122be2b5e701	Motherboards	Random SATA disconnects - which component is really at fault?	Frankly, I'm not sure which component is the issue but I posted this in the motherboard section because... well... these days, it's always the motherboard, isn't it? I think this is the fourth motherboard I'm on with this rig (CPU, RAM, casing and main SSD have stayed the same in the last 5 years). And it's been the same dance as with the other ones. First sign: USB ports not working properly - devices not being detected at all or Windows reporting that drivers could not be installed. Then a couple of days ago, Windows is stuck at the "preparing desktop" screen. I reset and boot into safe mode and am greeted with some "...system32...desktopprofile" or something "could not be found". While googling, trying to fix that crap and many reboots, I'd sometimes suddenly have an autoplay window pop up for my second hard drive. Which is actually permanently connected to an internal SATA port. Coincidentally, I moved the user profile location to it since my primary SSD is old and small. So I'm guessing that's what led to a corrupted Windows user profile. (And now that I think about it - in the past weeks, Firefox sometimes lost all cookies.) But I wonder - is it probably really the motherboard that's causing this or could it be the SSD? Or could it even be caused by Windows (7 by the way)? You know, I want to avoid getting a new motherboard only to find that the problem was really something else. Especially since I guess I can't RMA that possible POS since I can definitely proof that it is faulty? Or maybe I should just do a fresh Windows install, only set up the bare minimum and see whether I experience the same issues I do now? Although I feel like that would be wasted time and nerves because while Windows certainly has many issues, I've never heard of it causing random hardware disconnects. ... or could it even be caused by the power supply? Because at one point during the last weeks, I heard odd noises coming from the machine and they seemed to come from the power supply. I wasn't sure though whether it was caused just by a rattling fan or maybe a lose connection (you know, like when you jiggle a faulty cable and it makes that brrzzzz sound ). It occurs to me that all of this must really sound like my PC is just old and begging to be disposed of.  
f957ddf3-2603-4ca4-abc0-86d9757b1745	Motherboards	ASMEDIA USB controllers/drivers SUCK!!!!!	I was having trouble with a Startech USB 3.0 dual bay dock where it would take absolutely forever for Win10 to read HDDs when plugged into any USB 3.0 port on my motherboard. Sometimes it would not even bring them online. So I updated the drivers to the latest I could find from ASMedia and now CCleaner sees these drives as SSDs and will not let me do a multi-pass wipe on them. They do detect and come up pretty much instantly though. How in the world is ASMEDIA even in business with this big of bugs in their drivers. Maybe I should just be grateful that USB 3 finally works. The controller is ASM1042 and the driver version I installed is 1.16.28.0. Anybody have a newer one?

The Maximus 8 boards have a usb jack on the back that's dedicated to their "Keybot" function, which allows you to select boot options from a powered-off computer by hitting a key on the keyboard. I've found that if I connect a Logitech Unifying receiver to that USB jack, which has a wireless keyboard and mouse using it, the mouse will stop responding a few seconds after the desktop appears. Windows also doesn't seem to recognize the Unifying receiver when Keybot is active. Switching off Keybot results in Windows detecting the receiver and mouse control is regained. Has anyone been able to get ASUS Keybot to work with a Logitech wireless receiver?

Despite the boards M.2 slot fully supporting the 950 Pro on a Hardware level , MSI only officially supports 42 and 60 mm M.2 board lengths - This is a physical problem as there is not a screw mount to properly fix the 80mm long 950 Pro.

I'm trying to upgrade my media PC and I can't seem to find a micro atx board that has a digital coax audio output on the board. I searched newegg and there is nothing.

I see a number of server motherboards with C222 chipsets that support ECC, but they only seem to list the Xeon processors as supported. Intel's website says that the G1850 supports ECC RAM, though. Are there motherboards that support this combo?

However the analog audio out from the front of my case (and directly from the mobo, as well) is not functioning. The HD Audio is certainly hooked up properly to the mobo, and I've installed the most recent drivers. (I'm on windows 10). I have a GPU (NVidia 570) that is hooked up to my monitor via HDMI. As far as I can tell, the computer is sending the audio through the HDMI. Additionally, it seems to not detect when I plug in my headphones from either analog jack (front or rear port). Please help!  
ab15406f-0ad0-4c34-98ad-c62f633a0186	Motherboards	[H] Mobo Reviews	Odd question...is the demand for full ATX or E-ATX so large compared to MATX and other small form factors that the [H] tends weight its reviews that way? The whole first page of Mobo reviews is ATX or E-ATX..only on the second page can I find a few small ones but they seem to be more boutique. As a point of reference, I don't think I've bought an ATX board in nearly a decade...even when I did crossfire once. I could be out of "mainstream"...but I'm not sure what mainstream is anymore in the PC world.

8dc08f08-2582-4b62-928b-39d8250a5212	Motherboards	Well after 10 months my Gigabyte GA-B85M-D3H bit the dust	I got this board April 28th 2015 and 10 months later it is toast.. started to do the power cycle 8-20 times before it would actually boot up... I did read the reviews at the time and it seemed to have all positive results... now I go back and it seems like a lot of them are dead after a few months doing the same thing. So I started the RMA process but I have other plans for the replacement board.... To keep my PC up and running I got a GA H97M-D3H that I installed without incident and now my PC boots and runs without incident with my 4690K running at lowly 4GHz and no odd problems.

1007d0de-4dc6-4e1c-a96f-3a33edd4c7d7	Motherboards	Built 2 5930k systems, loaded defaults, one runs at 4 ghz, other at 3.5 ghz..??	As the title says, I built two really similar 5930k based systems at work. Main differences is one has an asus x99-a and the other an asus x99-deluxe. Memory is a bit different though with one being a little faster. However, while I loaded both systems with optimized defaults (have never really known much about overclocking), I loaded up RealBench and noticed that the score was significantly higher on one. Then I noticed that one is running at 4ghz constantly, and the other is setting a variable clock speed that ranges from 1.8 ghz to 3.5 ghz max. Why is the x99-deluxe system running faster if it was also loaded with the defaults? How can I make the x99-a system run at 4 ghz too? Heres a couple of pics: http://imgur.com/a/LcFS1 Thanks!  
7db64959-b792-4d10-8d1e-978b02a78a0d	Motherboards	Mystery stutter	I had a gtx 750, fx 6300, 4gb ram, 1T hdd / 300gb hdd, thermaltake 500w From time to time an intermitent stutter appeared only on the second part of phantom pain (most intensive than the first map) the other games worked fine. Then it started to happen on dying light and far cry 4, more frequently and more severe. fps dropped for some seconds and then back again to usual fps. So I decided to updrade my ram, I replaced one 1gb stick with a 8gb one. problem persisted, left only the 8gb one, the same, then placed it on the other slot, the same. Few days ago installed a R9 380 4gb.....same problem again, so I decided to install windows7 again.....same problem. Relevant data: -never overclocked anything. -max cpu temp 50°c, nice cooler. -max gpu temp 75°c [its normal for that gpu) Important data and why im posting here: -Its linked to drops in the gpu core clock and mem clock. -I doesnt happen in uniheaven benchmark maxed out, even for prolonged time. -It doesnt happen in tombRaider maxed out for prolonged time. -In those cases gpu stays at max temp and 100% usage but core clock and memory never drops like with other games, even stressing in the more demaning areas for prolonged time. What I think: -It seems psu is fine, its capable of give the gpu enough to max it out for long times. -Maybe if the psu is not enough because it cant provide power to both cpu and gpu at the same time...? [from what I readed if psu is the problem, pc just crash] -Problem seems to be located in motherboard or cpu from whatever reason...? Things I did with no success: -Defrags / tweaking the bios here and there / cleaning the dust inside the case and the fans / windows power saving / Tweaking the pagefile size / vsync on/off. ANY CLUE...? IM SURE THERE MUST BE A FIX Sorry for my english.

Like to indicate power is flowing through ? I already swapped PSU's so i know that's not the issue. I have a case of a dead PC atm (fans don't even spin up) and am trying to rule out if its the mobo is at fault. Right now I don't see anything light up but there could have been no LEDs to begin with. Thanks.

I have gone through my bios and I don't see any settings that look off (I've reset defaults etc..) but I still get the same behavior is there any hidden or settings anyone knows about that might be causing this? I know intell has some of its new features that are suppose to wake a PC up to install updates, or at the request of an application etc..

I am running the Intel DH67BL with an i7 2600k 3.4ghz cpu. I did have an ATI 5850 as my main video card and it worked fine. I recently purchased an ATI R9 290 and it will not post at all when that card is in place. I have made sure that it is seated properly and its getting the power it needs. I have gone through all the bios settings I could think of. Does anyone know what I could possibly be missing? I have even pulled the battery and reset everything on the system with no luck. I know the video card works because I put it in another system and it boots right up. Here is a link to the manual for the board. Intel® Desktop Board DH67BL  
05e06e83-070f-4113-b8c2-0e0b15bcddf5	Motherboards	ASUS z170-a vs Maximus Hero? Is it worth the extra $100?	It doesn't look like there's a bunch of difference between the two boards just by lining up specs vs specs, but I've also read that the ROG stuff is higher quality than the z170-A. Do any owners of either have input? I ask because I'm coming in a few hundred dollars under budget on my once-every-6-years gaming build, and want to make sure I'm not . I had originally thought about getting the ASUS z170-A, as it looked to have some decent features for modest overclocking and gaming, but I also see that the Maximus brand has a lot of fans. I figured that since I'm looking at a surplus, I'd might as well go a bit larger on some components that I haven't picked up yet. The mobo is one of them.

I have the means of upgrading right now with an $1100 budget for proc, mobo, case, ps, and maybe a new ssd for os. I already have a decent 970 gpu, and everything else. Or..i can funnel it back into mundane life stuff(bills etc)and go on waiting another year for Intel to shit out another mediocre platform. I am cynical and bitter i know, but i really would like to build a new rig, as it's been what, 5 years now? Geezust.. I have poked at x99/5820k, but 6700k simply seems better for gaming, and usb type c, dmi 3.0 etc etc. What to do..

60e03f8a-0d80-4bb6-acb2-b76b0cbc2218	Motherboards	2011v3 Motherboards With ECC Support Suggestions Needed	The CPU will most likely be a Xeon E5-2620v3. The reason I'm going with this CPU is I require PCIe Access Control Services (ACS) support on the CPU in order to properly virtualize PCIe passthrough. This CPU also has support for IOMMU super pages. Overclocking isn't a concern but I would be willing to pay extra for a motherboard that supports it. Motherboard requirements in decreasing order of importance: 2011-3 socket support ECC RAM (Unbuffered, I'm fine with 64GB support) M2 PCIe 3 x4 2 x PCIe 3 x16 Dual NIC (Intel) USB 3.1 Gen 2 (Alpine Ridge ?) Dual Bios Right now all I can see is this, but I'm hoping there's more out there. http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813182968 Is ECC the main thing that's holding me back from more selection?

It had been about a month since my last reboot and I decided to reboot before leaving for dinner and when the screen turned off it didn't come back on and the system was stuck on post code 02. I turned it off and turned it back on and it still wouldn't get past post code 02. I flipped the bios switch into the backup bios position and got into windows to download a newer bios and attempt a recovery on the first bios using the recovery method outlined online and in the manual. Recovery failed so I turned the machine off and flipped the switch back to the bios that was working, attempted to turn it back on and now the backup bios goes to post code 04, then 00, then immediately cycles power. I have tried reseating the cpu, swapping ram, swapping power supplies, clearing cmos, leaving the battery out of it for long periods of time and removing it from a case to ensure that it isn't grounding out on something. Nothing seems to work so I have initiated an RMA with MSI, and will likely get it sent out either tomorrow or monday. Any thoughts from anyone else?

Good morning everyone I am in the process of prepping my new A88X box to be my low power Hyper-V server but have ran into a snag with getting the RAIDXpert2 utility to do much of anything - I have a strong feeling it is related to this driver not being installed with the latest APU Catalyst build: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ti2EoEkJ9gM1o0UEh0V1lacjA/view?usp=sharing The core issue is that the RAIDXpert2 software won't see the RAID controller (I presume it is the above reason why...) https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ti2EoEkJ9gOUtwUm9lNXFnc1U/view?usp=sharing It shows "No Raid" even if the controller driver is installed and well - it is running Server 2012 R2 DC without any issues and the performance (surprisingly) has been great considering how cheap this setup was.

Look at that M.2 interface placement! The SLI PLUS is very much a "less is more" motherboard when it comes down to it feature set, so there is a lot less competition going on when it comes to PCB component placement, but that allowed MSI engineers to get your on-PCB M.2 SSD out from under your GPU. While not all folks have had issues with SSD throttling due to heatsoak, this would certainly help those that have. I like it.

My current Rig is danm near 7 years old.. it has held up good.. but now with games such as Fallout 4 and Black Ops 3 among other awesome titles coming out, its nearing the time to start a new build.. Its been so long ive been out of the hardware loop for many years.. today i was tinkering around tigerdirect and i seen this one Motherboard but the price seems abit hefty to me.. thou i do know it is a combo deal with a CPU.. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=9805491&Sku= But typically im a AMD guy.. I want to build something that can handle on normal settings games of today and the future.. im not into hardcore ultra high quailty, as long as it looks decent i am happy.. But i also want to build something that i can upgrade if need be down the years from now.. something that will last long such as my current system did.. now with all this in mind.. i want to start building something that wont cost an arm and a leg.. or my fiancee may have my head lol to be blunt lmao.. I would like to stick to AMD CPUs since ive used those in the past.. so if anyone can throw me some good wisdom on the latest AMD boards that dont run to high that fits into what im looking for into putting into my current system project.. id appreciate it.. Something that will last into many years while just sticking to normal quality.. i dont really do overclocking or extreme graphics and wont cost an arm and a leg. i do like the look of some of the Mobos that have thermal Armour on this.. but does that fancy Armour looking stuff really work or is it just for show and reason to jack up the price?

5725ecaa-4bde-4690-a5a2-66e27e9f841e	Motherboards	question about the asus Z10PE-D16 WS	i have a small deal lined up shortly with the advent of a deal made with a friend, the deal is basically he's looking to upgrade to a platform with PCI-E 3 since he's hit the limit of PCI-E 2 (he's a storage buff so we;re talking raid on enterprise grade SSD's and the like all going through a single raid card then a second raid card for the next set of drives and so on) the swap is an asus Z10PE-D16 WS swaps for an EVGA SR2 (with a pair of cpu blocks for good measure) and personally i think it's a good deal since that's £430 worth of board in swaps and SR2's go for about £1000+ on ebay and are rare as rocking horse crap, with all this im thinking it best to go that way rather than track one down, but there's a sweetener on this, if i can sort him even some cheap ES xeons for it (i know it's flaky territory) then i get his 4.7GHz (at decent volts) capable X5680's in with it too, but, im in need of a definitive answer as to weather or not this board will indeed support ES xeons or not, if anyone has any leads ill be very grateful and many thanks in advance for any responses.  
0aff74f7-331e-4307-85ff-a7b937d3e6dc	Motherboards	New retro rig upgrade (PCI to ISA enclosure)	Sooo, I was looking up stuff on Ebay and found a PCIe to PCI card... which I wasn't reall interested in. But it reminded me that I was still wanting a PCI to ISA card adapter. Low and behold, I found a setup that can add 7 ISA cards by using a PCI card in the computer.. then it has a cable that goes to an enclosure which uses another card that plugs into an ISA backplane which will give me 7 ISA slots. This thing cost almost $1200 new when it was being made. I got it for $66 shipped. https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=http://www.interface.co.jp/catalog/prdc.asp%3Fname%3Dpci-isu07fj&prev=search After I test it on my retro machine to make sure it will work for what I want it for, I will probably end up swapping the motherboard out for a faster one that uses DDR instead of SDRAM.. since I already have a few of those.
