I'm trying to determine what's the highest end video card I should put in to this PC.

bb7b85ab-e821-4002-9033-fc5b42e954ca	Video Cards	PC reboots when video card is under stress	Hello, I have the following problem: a while ago I was doing some work that's GPU intensive, and at the exact second I started it and the video card went 100%, the PC reboots itself. To check that it wasn't a problem specific to the task I was doing, I tried some games like Fallout 4 and GTA V (which a couple of months back I had played with no problems) and I got the same results, while other less consuming games like League of Legends run with no problems (most of the time. Sometimes it reboots too). This happens in both Linux and Windows, so I kind of discarded that it's software related. I also run 3DMark's benchmarks, with mixed results. The first and most basic benchmark, Ice Storm, runs fine, but the second one, Cloud Gate, makes the PC reboot instantly. The Furmark GPU stress test reboots instantly. Because I lack hardware knowledge, I find it difficult to diagnose if the problem is in the video card, or if it's some problem with the power supply. Relevant hardware: Video card: Gigabyte GTX 980 ti. PS: Thermaltake Smart 750w 80plus Bronze Both have 6 months of use.  
866bd9ca-50c4-4e5f-ba6e-7560b7079e35	Video Cards	Going from a 780 to either a 970 or 390x need advice.	So I've done some recent upgrades (6700K overclocked to 4.6Ghz , 16GB DDR4 3000mhz) to my well aged i7 930 setup (wow night and day difference!). My GTX 780 is next on the chopping block but I'm conflicted. I haven't really been following much of the past few years of GPU's and based on what I've read from benchmarks to user impressions I can't decide what card should be my next upgrade. I know Nvidia and AMD have new series cards coming sometime this year but I'm not really wanting to wait because I've got my friends all bugging me to start playing again (CS : GO , The Division and so on) so I want something better and competitive right now. I have a G-sync 1080p monitor and a 3 x Qnix setup (so 1440p) so that's the resolutions I'll be dealing with. Have zero interest in 4K and likely won't for sometime. VR isn't important because its in its infancy and right now I feel like I would rather wait for the second or third generation VR headsets before jumping in on that. So upgrading to a Freesync monitor is also really unlikely because I want a 1440p IPS that isn't a luck of the draw in terms of panel lottery (I've read people have returned up to 10 monitors and continued to always have problems so not really wanting to do that). Also I don't plan to run all 3 1440p Qnix's at the same time while gaming just one and the G-sync monitor now and again. I know the 970 has a crippled memory interface but how often does that effect VRAM heavy games? Will it be a serious issue in the future? Also from what I've seen the 390x shows varying performance and right now in Direct X 11 it seems inferior in a lot of benchmarks ( no offense to any fans just what I've been reading ) to the 970 which offers more stable fps while the 390x can climb higher in terms of fps but often has frequent dips. Also I have no idea how AMD drivers are. Last time I used an AMD card drivers were an absolute nightmare. What's everyone's opinion? Also I don't SLI. Its a pain in the ass. I do not feel like dealing with SLI malfunctions with every game or new driver release so single card solution only. Also the 980ti is too expensive for my blood right now so that's out of the question. Budget $400 as well. Thanks!

However, I might want to use Intel QuickSync in the future, so is it worth enabling the iGPU? Does it have any performance difference if I leave it enabled but don't connect any monitors to it? What is the recommended approach when using a dedicated PCIe card like my GTX 980? (Also, if it matters, my CPU is an i7-6700k) EDIT: It looks like DirectX 12 has a multi adapter feature that can use both integrated and discrete GPU for increased performance?

43504bd8-1fc4-4ae4-beed-c8c41da750dc	Video Cards	I have a feeling no one will win this round.	The closer we get to the release of next gen cards the more I get the feeling that there will be no clear winner. From what I've seen AMD won't go against the P100 until Vega maybe. So nvidia does win on that front. The Radeon Pro X2 is reallly no match. But in the battle that matters is where it seems R490x and GTX 1080 won't be much faster than the FuryX or GTX980Ti, so that could mean still no 4K capable card. I think nvidia will be faster in raw performance in DX11 but will still struggle with DX12 which should even the playyfield.

Its not the best but it is also better than the old 1080p screen i had. I currently have a 970 g1 gaming and it has been good for me so far for 1080p, but now with this new monitor it is struggling to keep decent frame rates at anything any higher than medium settings on the most recent game I am playing, The division. Everything else it is pretty decent running 45-60 ultra settings for the most part (some high some ultra). I was wondering if I should buy a 980ti and sell my 970. What are your thoughts on this, would i notice a significant increase in performance or should i wait until the consumer level pascal cards come out? I am not really interested in SLI due to the stories i have heard. thanks in advance!

c2fc6473-5600-49f1-92a6-3b7287ae4ef7	Video Cards	What GPU maker has the best RMA policy?	I'm in RMA hell with Asus right now. My R9 290 DirectCu II died in February, PC shut down in game and then wouldn't boot with the card plugged into any MB slot. Created online RMA, received by them ~March 13, sent back to me on the 17th still broken. Sent it a second time, received by Asus on the 23rd, been in repair status since then. This is frustrating because the rep I talked to when I called about the RMA (first one I started online) told me that I would receive a new card as soon as they received mine. On April 6 the L2 I spoke with explained that someone had made a mistake, my card qualified for advanced RMA and that's what they should have offered when I asked. But because they already have my card they cant do the cross ship option now. So I'm stuck waiting for them to do whatever they are going to do. This is a crossfire setup to drive my 4k setup so I'm still able to game just at low settings. I am not pissed or anything just surprised Asus sucks at this. TL;dr- I'm going to be buying a new GPU when Polaris/Pascal release. What brands don't suck with RMAs? I would gladly have paid a reasonable fee/agreed to a full value CC hold to cross ship at the start and was surprised Asus didn't offer it. Same goes for motherboards.  
c1a5bdc7-5f07-4717-a0de-7026218f81d1	Video Cards	why are used AMD cards so expensive?	I had planned to wait for pascal / polaris, but my new 29" LG ub67 21:9 monitor forced my hand. My 7770 could no longer cut the mustard. I went on classifieds, ebay, amazon looking for a 2nd hand card cheap. I expected a 7970 to sell for $125 but the cheapest one i could find was $230 + shipping, many over $300! for $300 thats brand new 970 GTX territory or maybe a R9 390. A few months ago i picked up a Zotac 970 GTX for $229 from jet, though i ended up trading it for other things i needed when i saw a 7770 played my games at 1080p fine. Long story short, i bought a R9 380 for $135 shipped after $20 mail in rebate and i sell ashes for $20. Its not as powerful as i wanted to go, but i can pass it down to one of my kids when new stuff ships. So anyone know whats going on with the market? are people mining coins again? Which i think is unlikely since new cards are not going up or out of stock...

c344482f-1f9d-4a78-8eff-89f9073edcf1	Video Cards	New build problem (980ti)	Hello, Extremely long time browser of this forum and thankful for all the great advice on here - finally have a question to post for myself I just completed a new build (first one in 4 years so it's a nice upgrade). Opted for the MSI 980Ti Gaming to match with a Dell U3415W, I7-6700K, 750W EVGA PS and basically all new parts aside from my legacy storage drives. It's only been a week of limited action but I've had about a half dozens crashes since the install while gaming. Summary: The Division - three crashes, screen freeze in all cases with signal still reporting to monitor, settings mostly ultra GPU temp was reporting in high 70C's (mid 40's FPS). Game has run fine for several hour sessions otherwise. This alone didn't alarm me given it's a new game. World of Warcraft - about 7 crashes, blackscreen at various points from just launching, to a few minutes in the game. Have had to hard reboot each time (can't get back to Windows). Game has run fine for short sessions otherwise. Settings ultra, temps pretty low (50C's). At least on crash had the game music still playing in background. Ark - two crashes, same as WoW, blackscreen. Otherwise had a few longer play sessions, temps/fps seemed in line with expectations when the game was running (never exceeded 80C). Dragon Age: Inquisition - Did not crash yet but seems to have a problem launching (need to launch it twice for it to "stick") I've tried three iterations of NVIDIA drivers rolling back to December and crashes occur regardless. Card fans are running, temps look normal and have not done any overclocking at all (installed Afterburner/Riva but did not tweak). I've not had much time at all to play so this feels like a lot of trouble early on. In 2 hours alone last night 4 of the above crashes took place. I reviewed the system logs and prior to each crash there was an event related to the video driver which funny enough said it successfully recovered. I pulled the card out and am going to swap it out at MicroCenter today and am hopeful that solves it, but am worried it won't :-/ Regards

I already swapped PSU's and added a second gtx 670, this only happens when the one "problem" 670 is being used in SLI.. so definitely the problem card.

f2fb14e5-6682-4682-a788-072322b355e4	Video Cards	Quantum Break another example of poor optimisation from console?	Not only poor optimisation but also rushed for release on PC. Watching and listening to the Digital Foundry report regarding PC version of Quantum Break I feel brings home this trend of what is happening with regards to priority development and optimisation on console that is then followed up on PC and both rendering engines and other optimisations end up being reduced. My favourite example of how consoles are influencing PCs (and some times IMO directly GPUs) was how Witcher III graphics render engine that initially looked great at its 1st demo presentation had to be redone to be efficient with consoles. That engine was used on both consoles and PC, and lead to many being upset about graphics being degraded/parity even if they were not aware that they had to change the engine for valid reason. Back to Quantum Break. Now we are seeing some face palm moments with the PC project development-release of Quantum Break on PC. It is using the same identical rendering engine, that not only has its optimisation based around console but critically still is at 720p and upscaled (temporal reconstruction) affecting texture-objects-aliasing-etc. Watching the video is painful, and kind of reminds me of the days when developers could not use Tessellation correctly causing massive impact for AMD hardware. A good example in the video is where they show a lot of the issues come from the lighting/particles, which if this was also optimised for NVIDIA could be done in ways to seriously improve performance in DX12. On the plus side it is good on AMDs in comparison and that is something to cheer them up Enjoy the video, or wince Got to give AMD credit in wrapping up the console market as a soft benefit (beyond hard cash) is now coming to fruition IMO. This does not mean NVIDIA is in trouble, it does mean a lot more work needs to be done by developers and possibly with NVIDIA, although some of this may also be less of an impact on Pascal but we will have to wait and see. Cheers

I paid $2,500 for the card in 1993 and had to upgrade my Amiga 3000 with more ram and a second hard drive since the software was about 100MB and my main drive was only a 120MB. So I bought a 345MB Maxtor for $345 and 8MB of Ram for $300 for a grand total of $3,145 in 1993. I didn't even own a car at the time, but I had a $7,000 computer, lol. When I bought the GTX980 for $560 14 months ago, I was thinking. damn, that is kind of expensive. I guess now that I am older I look at money differently, especially since I don't have any anymore, lol

I despise Nvidia's busines practices also along with their walled garden approach where they only make or buy tech that benefits their cards. That being said what hardware reviews I have found for Linux and my own personal experience suggest that Nvidia drivers cream AMD on Linux and even a GTX 950 can hang on with a Fury X so the GTX 970 should be my obvious choice.

Dead video card resurrected!	i want to give antipesto93 from ocforums.com the credit for this, he is the one that gave me the idea! http://www.ocforums.com/showthread.php?t=606658 my 8800gtx died a little over 3 months ago. went ahead and ordered a new video card because i figured the card is completely dead without having to pay to send it in and get it repaired because i didnt register it when i bought it initially(dumb, i know...). anyway, i am posting this message running off my 8800gtx! i got the idea from another forum, because some guy in the UK bought a dead 8800gtx off of ebay that had red vertical lines through the screen...my card had the same symptoms...one day it locked up on me, rebooted, then locked up on me even quicker...rebooted, red lines all over the screen and windows wouldnt even boot. i tried the card in a friends computer with the same result... sooooooo, i removed all bits from the card including the i/o shield and placed it gpu side down with the card raised up on 3 sides by tiny balls of aluminum foil and placed it on a very thin cookie sheet. i preheated the oven to 385f, put the card in and waited around 8-10 minutes. i carefully removed the cookie sheet and placed it on top of the oven to cool down naturally. waited about an hour and voila! =D supposedly this is similar to a trick used to fix dead xbox 360s. some sort of electrical connection gets frail and it eventually fails because of some tiny micro-fractures in solder joints or something....anyway heating the components up helps melt the solder and form new joints. im now torn as to whether i should sell this card for cheap to someone or keep it as a backup... pics of said baking(re-enactment) naked! side shot propped up on foil another angle in the oven akashi_tm has been kind enough to provide a short, easy to follow video tutorial for the baking process. i would like to remind everyone please do this with utmost caution, care and patience. Xtreme Bakeover - baking your video card to fix micro-fissures link to akashi_tm's original post about the video EDIT FOR LAPTOP BAKING! it has been a good week for baking... I bought a laptop with borked video because i was fairly positive it could be fixed by baking... It is working now after 7m 45s @ 385f in a conventional oven. i noticed a heavy solder smell when pulling the board out of the oven. PICS! EVERYTHING WAS REMOVED FROM THE MOTHERBOARD! All protective covers/plastic. gdonavan was able to get his broken 37" LCD tv to work by baking the mainboard. check out his post! trick_m0nkey has shown us another method of fixing a dead gpu on a laptop motherboard using a heat gun. check it out here!

3daa2576-e90a-4455-9bbc-e6fab268a946	Video Cards	GPU / PSU Pins Question	Hey guys, so I recently bought a used R9 280x (just the card, no adapters or extras) as to replace my GTX 660. Unfortunately I came home to find out that the 280x requires both a 8-pin and a 6-pin connector from my PSU. I have a decent PSU that I'd bought many years back, an Enermax Liberty 620W. (ENERMAX Liberty ELT620AWT 620W ATX12V SLI Certified CrossFire Ready Modular Active PFC Power Supply - Newegg.com) Unfortunately, I got only 2 x 6-pin cables intended for the GPU. Am I going to be able to get away with powering the 280x on just the 2 x 6-pins? Is it risky to try? Would my only alternative option be to buy a new PSU? Thanks for your feedback!

a8c69bb2-0399-4f24-b304-a6a1131343b0	Video Cards	What limits gpu die size?	I ask because I was looking at a graphic for polaris 10 and 11 over on wccftech (so we know it must be true) showing off the relative sizes. AMD 14nm FinFET Polaris GPU Size Leaks Out - 232mm² Large Die I don't know if they were to scale, but assuming they were, I used microsoft paint to stitch together the smaller die to see what size it would take up. Here is what I found, placed right next to polaris 11. Assuming the two die sizes are to scale, it looks like polaris 11 is right around 4 times the area of polaris 10. And assuming polaris 10 is the gpu that was slated to have a 232mm^2 die size... then does that imply polaris 11 could have a ~908mm^2 die size ?!?!??? (for reference, the largest nvidia titan dies were in the 600 and change square mm range) It seems like that would be crazy large, larger than anything ever reported. So it's probably not the case but... Could that even be done? What limits die size? I remember hearing that the reason they did not build fury x even larger was that they were constrained by lithography. I heard that on a Scott Wasson techreport podcast. But I have NO CLUE what any of that means. Is that still a constraint with the 14nm die shrink? Is it the same constraint or can they go larger now? Is it that a die that size would get WAY too hot to deal with? That constraint might be solvable when you consider that polaris is supposed to be a much more efficient architecture coupled with the accumulated power savings gains of hbm over gddr5. So.. is a die that large possible? And if not, what limits it?

d8e8a556-de53-494f-bd37-3026ead78b96	Video Cards	GPU problem or something else?	Over the last two weeks my main gpu (Asus R9 290x DC2 OC) has been getting to 94c in roughly 15 minutes while gaming. Usually at least once while playing a game in 1hr or less any game will minimize. No matter how aggressive a fan profile I put the card always reaches 94c. Happened on the newest Crimson driver, the first Crimson, and the driver prior to that. Very recently I've noticed that even when playing videos on youtube or other sites I'll get either heavy screen tearing or stuttering when in full screen (100% of the time) or sometimes while playing in the window. I've changed Windows themes to basic and back to aero, enabled & disabled hardware acceleration, etc and nothing seems to fix it. Flash is updated and I've turned off all extensions in both FF and Chrome and it still happens. I recently purchased a Kraken G10 and Corsair H55 to put on the main gpu, but I haven't yet because I do not want to remove the warranty stickers if this issue could possibly be gpu related. I'm hesitant to rma because it's Asus and we know how that process can be (myself first hand). In [H]'s opinion, is my gpu dying?

The Radeon Pro Duo will be the fastest AMD card at least until 2017 when Vega is released. That doesn't bode well for polaris performance. DDR 5X is not yet available in volume nor Hynix HBM2. So polaris is stuck with DDR5 and HBM1. So its either large memory or high bandwidth. Still, apparently AMD is better at DX12/Vulkan and it can best Maxwell on perf/watt so it might be enough to tip the scale.

So I'm building my girlfriend a gaming PC (will have a heavily overclocked 3570K, 16 GB DDR3 and SSD drive) and I've got it almost figured out apart from the GPU. She will be playing at 1080p. I know that Nvidia and AMD are releasing new cards in the summer but it's going to be a birthday gift so I'd rather have it together and working then rather than wait for new parts to drop. Right now it seems that the prices for 970 and 390 are roughly the same while the 390X is about 100 euros more expensive. Can't go used, Finnish retail prices are so high the used ones end up costing about the same as new ones from Germany. I've owned two 970 before and was very happy with them. I haven't used AMD cards in years so I was wondering if the 390 is a more future proof option right now. She'll most likely want to play Witcher 3 and some games on Dolphin emulator. Please advice.

Everyone seems focused on framerates but I find the issue to get a game running smoothly when you got it already running over 60 fps constantly is Frametimes. Rivatuner seems to be the best way to set the limit of your FPS to you Refresh rate to get better Frametimes. I notice that 1080p frame times are half of 4K frametimes. If one is trying to get the lowest frametimes to reduce input lag, wouldn't you want to run games at 1080p to get lower input lag? So for instance, if the frametimes at 1080p are 25ms avg and 4K they are at 50MS average, playing at 4K would add 25ms to your input lag, correct? I know that using RTSS to limit frame rate and turning off vsync is the best way to get better frametimes. Anyone know any other ways?

How well do you think he can game on modern games in a rig like that with no OC and a simple 21-inch monitor? I have another old rig as a backup for myself with a 280X so I am familiar with the cards but had no idea how that mix might play. For myself I am waiting for an 8 gig 390x as my next card after the prices go down in anticipation of the next releases this fall.

What kind of compatibility issues would I have from a sli setup? I understand that some games don't support it but how common is it for a game not supporting sli? Would it be more beneficial for me to just sell my 770 and take the money for the second 770 and buy something along the lines of a 970?

a70ab7a5-0386-4640-89c6-b51de0e7f6b4	Video Cards	Issues with nvidia 760 Ti (Dell/Alienware OEM)	So I bought this card on Craigslist... (always a good start to a story.) Listing was a bit unclear, said 760 in one spot, 760Ti in another. Card is completely unbranded, black 760-style reference shroud. Since the 760Ti is pretty rare and apparently OEM-only, I figured it was most likely just a 760. From what markings there are I've concluded it is an OEM Dell/Alienware 760 Ti. I've tried the card in a couple machines, Ivy Bridge era. Z68 Gigabyte (legacy bios) - No bios/splash screen, nothing on windows boot (on any port.) Z77E Asrock (UEFI) - Boot screen and boots to Windows only on DVI-I, nothing on any other port. I didn't install drivers as the machines are currently running Radeon cards; shouldn't matter for just booting to desktop. Fwiw the DVI-I also works on my Mac Pro tower; nothing on the other ports. (generally speaking, a 760 should work in a Mac Pro with no boot screen; I don't know about a 760 Ti - I doubt many have tried this specific card.) So obviously it is happier with UEFI but I have no idea if the card is defective on the other ports, or if there is some Dell-specific firmware causing problems?

I made a short video and threw it up on YouTube so you could see/hear for yourself. Unfortunately the wind noise filter on my camera was on when I was filming so it didn't really pick it up as well as I'd hoped. Anyways, I've already tried to RMA the card via Memory Express (the retailer I bought it from) but they found it as a no-fault fan, which is complete BS. Anyone in the vicinity of the PC at my place can hear the fan noise loud and clear. Is there any fixes for something like this? Can I RMA via ASUS directly? Is there an ASUS rep on here that could possibly help me out? Cheers.

Just want something today to be done with my build already. I don't mind upgrading in 2 years. Thanks!  
964bdf32-6dfd-425d-8320-da2cadfceaad	Video Cards	Whats more important? High Resolution or Anti-Aliasing?	So I been wondering.. Whats more important overall? It seems to me that resolution is more important, and with high enough resolution AA may be completely irrelevant. For example, I play two games at the moment. Company of Heroes 2 and Fallout 4. I have two monitors. One is 1080p and the other is 1440p. I can max out both games at 1080p with every single option on highest setting and I am still in the high 50's or low 60's. 1440p is off course a different story. The funny thing is, I can run CoH2 with everything set to maximum, except AA. As soon as I set it to anything higher than low, the fps fall into 20's. Still I have to say, that CoH2 does seem to look better @ 1440p with AA "off" or "low" than it does at 1080p with AA on "Very High". Is it just me? Am I missing something? PS: The video card in question is GTX 970.

I've read a lot of reviews about the 980 saying they generally aren't worth the price tag based on the performance they produce vs the 970 and 980 Ti. Seems that the 980 is the classic "middle child". However... I have an opportunity to buy one off a friend of a friend for $330. It's the EVGA 980 SC with the ACX cooler.

I know new generation of cards are in the near future, but I don't know when they are going to be released. And the only real upgrade I would consider is a 980 Ti or a Fury X, the xfire route doesn't really seem appealing to me, too many bugs, high power consumption, etc...

[DE_Steve] Optimization coming in 18.5-AMD's mesh optimizer reduces overdraw • /r/Warframe Warframe a F2P game that is always in the top 10 on Steam as far as people daily playing it, recently utilized GPUOPEN to optimize the game for Update 18.5. Digital Extremes own Steve Sinclair has been bragging for a long time about how great AMD's Mesh Optimizer works. Today Update 18.5 went live and the results are mind blowing! Tootles is the truth! My frame rate shot out of the roof with this update! I'm seeing 240+ fps in some areas. The game is beautiful; not your conventional F2P title. Since GPUOPEN is free and hardware agnostic, it works just as well on Nvidia's hardware it seems. The game runs so much better now that the development team added in all manner of visual additions to the game. Lights that were once static now flash because they have so much more power on tap for the game. The textures are so much cleaner now. Everything just looks a helluva lot better. Everything. Literally everything! It was a 4GB+ patch to give you an idea on how much stuff changed. Oh and this is an Nvidia sponsored title. At one point it was bundled with all Nvidia cards. GPUOPEN is freaking awesome! I can't wait to see what others contribute to the initiative and make gaming better for all budgets in the future. Free tools like this that can be utilized by all graphics cards are what make PC Gaming great. Sharing ideas, utilizing those ideas, and bringing great experiences to the masses. Today is a great day to be a PC Gamer.

51e43f90-3863-4859-814f-23d0ff4f144d	Video Cards	Who has the better 'current tech'?	It is quite obvious that NVidia has had the better sales and marketing.... but going on tech alone, who has the 'leg up' going into the next generation? Essentially, we are looking at Fiji and Tonga vs Maxwell... Both made big power usage strides and both made big advancements in DX12 related architecture. AMD brought forth HBM technology, while NVidia seems to have edged out a victory in the power/thermal department (both improved). When isolating the new architectures from the overall success of the new lineups, the 'current generation' looks much more balanced than people would lead you to believe. That said, who would you consider to have the better technology going into the next generation? An interesting thought, considering how imbalanced the GPU scene appears due to the success of nVidias Maxwell lineup.

8dfebdb9-5cf2-445a-84ec-8dbb90dad9a0	Video Cards	Video Card Question	Hello Everyone, I am updating a pc that a friend of mine built for me in Oct 2010 based on suggestions from this forum. Needless to say it has been an outstanding PC and I am forever grateful. Well interestingly, one of my RAM modules was dead and I am torn on whether to replace or just update it. I decided to just update it. My build is (sorry no links since I am new to the forum): Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit AMD Phenom II X4 955 Black Edition + Mushkin Enhanced Blackline 2 x 2GB DDR3 1333 RAM MSI 880GM-E43 AMD 880G mATX Motherboard Corsair 650TX 650W PSU Samsung Spinpoint F3 HD103SJ 1TB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive Cooler Master Elite 335 RC-335-KKN1-GP ATX Case Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus HSF for LGA 1366 and LGA 1156 I purchased the Mushkin Enhanced Blackline 2 x 2GB DDR3 1333 RAM with G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Desktop Memory Model F3-12800CL8D-8GBXM Where I am stuck is in purchasing a video card. I play mostly emulators with my 5 yr old twins, so it is not like I am a serious gamer but for instance when I used to run the Dolphin Emulator on my build it was pretty slow and choppy. My goal for this machine is for it to last two more years before I build a new one. Would I benefit from a videocard? If so, what card would you recommend given the age of the machine? I could be wrong but my impression is that I will only get a marginal improvement in performance because of the limitations of the other components. Thanks

a21fbd87-b15e-4d40-9444-214e4a2e7716	Video Cards	DX12 and running 2 diff class of cards same vendor	Not sure if this thread belongs in here. So there's lots of info out there on running AMD and NV cards on the same machine using DX12. I have 2 questions/points of curiousity: 1. I'm more curious on if there's any performance gain on running two different class of cards from same vendor. Example: I have a 980ti, can I boost my performance on DX12 games if I buy a used 780 GTX to pair with my 980ti? I haven't run multi GPU since 6950 xfire . From my understanding, if I did that currently (non-DX12), the 780 will slow down my 980ti. My understanding was that DX12 is supposed to pool all GPU resources from different cards into a big pool. Or am I wrong? 2. Even if a game is DX12, does it specifically need to be coded to support the one big GPU pool that I mentioned in point 1?

ffc21ca1-f5b3-4273-9512-71fac7b35f65	Video Cards	MSI R9 380 4GB: Max power consumption is very low?!	I am using MSI R9 380 4GB and i am having some severe FPS issues in GPU-intensive games like ARK: Survival Evolved. My PSU is 750W Seasonic SS-750AM2 and two separate 6pin cables are leading from the PSU to the GPU. At first i thought it was normal since that game is demanding, but then i saw that people with weaker GPUs (and overall PCs) are getting much better frames on higher graphic qualities. So i did the toughest Furmark 1.17 stress testing (stress test over an hour on maximum settings at 1080p). That most difficult test got my FPS down to 25, my GPU temperature to 72 celsius and my GPU's maximum (highest peak) power consumption to barely 140 watts. At the same time i kept GPU-Z and HWMonitor active as well, and they recorded the same 138-140 watts maximum power consumption. As far as i could see my GPU was under maximum load, the FPS in Furmark was at barely 25 and GPU load was stated to be at 100%. In 3DMark Firestrike under the standard (1920*1080) test my score was 7515 (graphic score 8554, physics score 12295, combined score 3017). In Unigine Valley (1920*1080 and highest settings) my score is 923 (min FPS 22, max fps 65). In both 3DMark and Unigine tests the GPU-Z reported my GPU's maximum power consumption at 120 watts (VDDC Power highest reading). In my most GPU intensive game Ark Survival in the Radeon Universal Overdrive it says my GPU is 100% active, the GPU clock is 980MHz and my Memory clock is 1425MHz. It also states my temperature is at 65 celsius and my cooler is at 30%. GPU-Z claims my GPU is consuming barely over 102 watts while having 15 FPS in ARK. Various websites, articles and youtube videos show the same GPU model as mine go up as high as 200+ watts under maximum load (both in games and stress tests/benchmarks). The MSI official website shows my model of GPU to go up to 190 watts without any specific overclocking. I am just a tech amateur, but something seems very wrong when my GPU is under-performing and is seemingly using a small amount of power compared to other GPUs of the same model. I took a look at the inside of my PC, the GPU seems properly inserted into the MBoard and the two separate 6pin cables from the PSU (750W Seasonic SS-750AM2) are firmly plugged into my GPU's two power jacks. The GPU and the whole PC is clear of dust so that is not an issue, and software-wise i am using the latest AMD drivers and all Windows 7 updates and my startup programs are at a bare minimum (anti-virus paused during the tests). PC specs: Intel Core i7 4790K ASUS MAXIMUS VII HERO 16GB DDR3 2400MHz Kingston HyperX MSI Radeon R9 380 4GB SATA3 7200 1TB WD Black 750W Seasonic SS-750AM2 Windows 7 64bit Service Pack 1 Here is an imgur link to a big screenshot with additional info about my PC: http://i.imgur.com/zYm6kkr.png I got no clue what is going on... looks like my GPU is unable (or refusing) to draw more power from the PSU?

7f339c95-6d6a-4218-be45-78d757f7c68a	Video Cards	Measuring the Performance of Each Game will Necessitate...	I was just reading what Ryan wrote over at PCPer yesterday and the following statement very much got my attention. PC Gaming Shakeup: Ashes of the Singularity, DX12 and the Microsoft Store | PC Perspective Benchmarking is likely going to see a dramatic shift with move to these app-style games on Windows 10, as the sandboxed nature will keep anything from “hooking” into executable as we have seen in the past. This means that overlays, like Fraps, EVGA Precision X, MSI Afterburner and even the FCAT overlay we would like to use for our capture-based Frame Rating testing, are kind of at a standstill. Measuring the performance of each game will necessitate the game developer writing an in-game benchmark mode that exports the kind of information that we want to see measured, and that we trust them to do it correctly, and that it will properly represent the experience the user sees. Click to expand... I have to say that deep down, one part of me would love to see this happen industry-wide. It would bascially mute a lot of voices in the industry that only bark about data points. It is sad to think that we NEED benchmark numbers to write video card and game performance reviews. While I understand that video card reviews with zero framerate data is something far left of where the industry is at now, it is interesting to see video card reviewers basically tell us that they cannot do their jobs without these tools. Framerate is not the gaming experience. The fact is that it has been my contention for a long time that we at HardOCP could possibly write a video card review with zero framerate data and give you as good, if not a better conclusion as it pertains to actually playing games with the video cards in question. However drawing those conclusions without "facts" is not acceptable today. (I have suggested for years that motherboard benchmarks in reviews are worthless, and I still believe I am 100% correct in that.) The fact is that framerate data is not needed to figure out if a video card supplies you with a great gaming experience. In some ways, you could argue that framerate data tends to overshadow really what we should be focused on when buying a video card...the overall experience it is going to provide you with.
