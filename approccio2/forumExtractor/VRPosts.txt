f18c9e1e-1057-4e98-88b3-13e422bbb3ef	VR and Mounted-Displays	The First VR Surgery Will Be Broadcast This Week	I can see something like this being hugely beneficial to medical students or for training purposes. If you have Google Cardboard, you can download an app and watch the first live VR stream of the surgery on Thursday. On 14 April, Ahmed – a surgeon, cancer specialist, and co-founder of virtual and augmented reality firm Medical Realities – is going to cut off a tumour from the colon of a London man in his 70s. That's a routine operation with no particular risk attached. But unlike any other operation, when Ahmed and his team remove the cancer, a 360-degree camera rig mounted over the operating table will capture the doctors' every movement in 4K and livestream it globally in VR.

6d96c8d0-5a17-4802-873f-eeed784e0a47	VR and Mounted-Displays	Vive vs. Elite: Dangerous, stuttering	Has anyone else whose Vive has arrived tried Elite? Loading into the cockpit for the first time was by far the biggest "wow" moment I've had with it so far, which is saying something. The sensation of really being in the ship is just ridiculous. BUT. Then I took off, and there's not quite a stutter, but a sort of periodic "pulsing" of the movement of things outside the ship, 2-3 times per second. The head tracking seems to be fine, nice and smooth, and I don't think it's a detail thing because it's the same whether the settings are max or min. There's understandably not much out there regarding ED on the Vive yet, so apart from a bunch of issues people had with the Rift which don't seem quite the same, I haven't had any success tracking down the cause. It's a bummer because even with the issue it's still playable and often breathtaking in dogfights, and so cool to be able to lean forward to look around the edges of the windows.  
9d4b72bd-b4e7-4e12-927f-0e5050b025d2	VR and Mounted-Displays	HTC Vive Review	Gizmodo published a review of the HTC Vive today and, when all was said and done, they felt that it was a "beautiful machine with no good games." Another drawback? Cables. Lots of cables. Virtual reality has always been an expensive hobby. Even in 1995, when the only VR option was the Nintendo Virtual Boy, it was hard to justify spending money on the device. It was uncomfortable to wear. It didn’t have any good games. And it was a little ahead of its time. Fast forward to this week, and after spending hours playing with the HTC Vive, I can safely say that VR is still an overpriced novelty.

Via Reddit: Oculus's services are always on and you should be concerned. • /r/oculus When you install Oculus Home a background service with full permissions is spun up and never spun down. This service is used to detect when the rift is turned on so it can automatically launch the rift, but it is also used to constantly communicate with facebook servers. Source: overview for WeAreVr-nn23 Now this should be concerning, if you look at Oculus' privacy agreement you will find these: >Information Automatically Collected About You When You Use Our Services. We also collect information automatically when you use our Services. Depending on how you access and use our Services, we may collect information such as: >Information about your interactions with our Services, like information about the games, content, apps or other experiences you interact with, and information collected in or through cookies, local storage, pixels, and similar technologies (additional information about these technologies is available at https://www.oculus.com/en-us/legal/cookies-pixels-and-other-technologies/) Considering facebook has a sordid past with recording and analyzing through phone microphones this should be concerning. A bit further in Oculus's privacy agreement you will find: >How do we use information? >We use the information to do a number of things that help us provide our Services to you and our partners. Here are some examples: >To market to you. We use the information we collect to send you promotional messages and content and otherwise market to you on and off our Services. We also use this information to measure how users respond to our marketing efforts.

4182db94-709c-4261-a29a-ea4b9fd31dc7	VR and Mounted-Displays	"Playstation VR Is Ridiculously Polished For Something Still in Development"	I personally can't wait for the Playstation VR, and I personally believe PSVR will make or break the possibility of VR being mainstream. But this latest just got me even more excited. "Can it really compete with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive? Having just tried it, I can safely say: Hell yes." "Yet as rough as the alpha version of the was, it made one thing clear: The PS VR headset itself is very close to being finalized and feels absolutely nothing like the Rift or the Vive felt at this stage of the game." "First, there’s only one necessary plug needed between headset and console. Total. The Vive has an entire melange of cords and ports needed to get to gaming and the Rift requires at least a USB cord and HDMI cable (bundled together to snake out of the headset to the PC)." "And second, it’s really easy to put on and focus the headset. Both the Rift and the Vive require some adjustments to get content in focus, particularly if, like me, you’re a stunning example of human evolution and require glasses to see the world. While the Rift and Vive are more customizable than PS VR there’s something to be said for a headset that just works. I wore a lot of headsets last night and never had to do more than make sure I had each properly seated on my noggin. Focus was always smooth." "After spending the last month living and breathing VR, I’m surprised at how refreshing the PS VR demo felt. There’s a polish to the experience that’s just never been there with the Rift and Vive." I personally think this is the biggest thing: "The Vive was created by a mobile phone company and the Rift by a Kickstarter startup. The PS VR is being built by one of the largest consumer electronics companies in the world, and it has decades of experience, not just in gadgets, but specifically in gaming. They’re also the third major headset to the game so they’ve no doubt learned a lot from the early missteps of Oculus and HTC." Sony for years has been perfecting their camera, motion tracking technology starting with the Playstation 2. I think Sony has the best chance for success in the VR space as of right now. It has all their developers and partners making games for it. I just hope Sony sticks with it and really pushes it. I know the arguments on these forums are going to be about how the PS4 is so underpowered, but I think the experience itself, the cost, and the fact that it doesn't have 452 wires running all over the damn place to make it work is going to be a hit. Not to mention that there are well over 40 million people already who have a PS4 and developers can take advantage of the hardware given enough time to really take advantage of the hardware. I think it's entirely possible to have a game that looks as good as Uncharted 4 or The Order 1886 in VR one day. Oh, and Ace Combat 7 is being made from the ground-up for PSVR. A fucking ACE COMBAT game made specifically for VR is a Holy shit moment. And this isn't going to be any Ace Combat Assault Horizon bullshit. This is going to be the Ace Combat we've been wanting for a long time. http://gizmodo.com/playstation-vr-is-ridiculously-polished-for-something-s-1769594537 I want to add this quote I found that perfectly describes my feelings towards the VR competition: "But affordability and accessibility are just as, if not more, important than capability and specs. At least when it comes to the general public."

I want to make the plunge but I want to make sure I am plunking down the money on the right one for me. Is there much else to consider when comparing these two? My gut tells me just spend the extra 200 bucks and get the Vive. Does the Rift have any advantages for a seated experience or does the Vive pretty much perform the same in that area? Will vive users be able to purchase games from the Rift store?

I have it hooked up to my receiver via HDMI which is required for Dolby Digital HD/Atmos and DTS-MA/DTS-X. Originally I planned on just plugging in the headset as a display but use my existing speakers for audio as the quality of the audio and spacial positioning would be far superior to using headphones. I preordered the Rift but after reading up on it a bit I've learned this may not be possible which would be a deal breaker for me. I've also been seriously contemplating cancelling my Rift order and going with the Vive for other reasons. I'm wondering if anyone here has experience with using either headset with external speakers or setting the headsets up in a similar environment to what I have?

I can just imagine this huge drop in visual fidelity is going to be an issue for me, I've read that it's easily forgotten about when you're actually immersed in a game. Is this the case? Or is it just not good enough?.. I mean i get it, GPU's just aren't up to snuff yet for these HMD's to be pushing out 4+k resolutions, even for most enthusiasts. There was no way around it. But is it so bad, that I should wait till the hardware is there? or is dropping $800 worth it at this point in time?

I'm running 3x Dell 2312HM via displayport connected to a 980ti. So the card has one hdmi port that will be connected to the Vive. I have a 42" TV with hdmi ports that I want to connect as a spectator display. So I'm going to need to get a hdmi splitter but here is where I need help. My monitors only have DP input and I'm pretty sure a regular hdmi to DP cable won't work without a converter. So here is my question. From one of the gpu displayport output, I'm going to run a DP to hdmi cable into the splitter input. From the the splitter with 2x hdmi output, one hdmi cable will run to the tv and the second output will be a hdmi to DP converter. From that converter I will plug in a DP cable to connect it to my main monitor. Will this setup work? I need to make sure before I drop $50 on the converter.

I went with the Oculus Rift because it looks more comfy and they have had so much time to perfect their SDK. Plus as shitty as it sounds, they seem to have exclusive titles but steam doesn't. I want to play games, so I went with Rift. I also got a galaxy s7, so I got my gear VR with that too. **EDIT** Decided to say Fuck it and bought the vive too. I might end up selling the rift or cancelling it, depending on if I get my vive first. (I have an april ship date for the rift, but a may ship date on vive)

Back then, the hardware wasn't up to scratch, the experience didn't live up to expectations and I felt that Oculus had a real mountain to climb in turning what was clearly experimental hardware into a consumer-ready product. The great news is that Oculus has done it. The Rift is highly recommended, and I can't wait to see where this revolutionary technology takes us.

As the picture above indicates, it didn’t exactly make me feel brilliant...after a morning’s worth of different Rift games, I felt disorientated, a touch nauseous, and distinctly headachey...after five hours I felt like I needed a lie-down in a dark room...It’s not that the games are badly made, or that the headset is uncomfortable to use: developers appear to have figured out the ground rules of VR now and no finished Oculus game makes you feel actively unwell, like some of the earlier demos could...but jumping between different realities turns out to be quite taxing on the brain...I also had very attractive red marks all around my face from wearing the headset all day...

Unfortunately, Ethan Carter has comfort issues too, for exactly the same reason as Project Cars - a large disconnect between motion as you see it and as you feel it...The difference is that The Astronauts have included a comfort mode, effectively robbing you of free movement in the game world...Instead, the game viewpoint has you rooted to the spot, navigating around the world by clicking on in-world arrows that take you where you want to go. It feels like a compromise too far, but it does comprehensively address the issue... Oculus Rift review

What seems pretty cut-and-dry gets complicated in a hurry when you consider that none of these are standalone platforms; they all rely on additional hardware – be it a computer, a game console or a smartphone – to power the experience.

Aside from contact lenses, I guess you'll just have to buy glasses that fit inside your VR headset.

bd864371-edfc-46c8-964a-5367edae0074	VR and Mounted-Displays	10 Ways NVIDIA Is Making VR A Reality	NVIDIA has created the VRWorks SDK to provide headset and application developers with the best performance, lowest latency, and plug-and-play compatibility for VR. The top game engines that are being used for creating VR games are now integrating NVIDIA VRWorks, including Unity, Unreal Engine, and Max Play. HTC and Oculus headsets have added support for VRWorks. It’s being adopted by cutting-edge VR developers like Sólfar Studios with Everest VR, Valve Software with The Lab, ILMxLAB with Star Wars Trials on Tatooine and InnerVision Games with Thunderbird: The Legend Begins. Any solution is only as good as the GPU’s drivers. Our Game Ready drivers are recognized as the best in the industry. NVIDIA works closely with developers to make sure games perform well on the day the game ships. This is incredibly important for VR, as the slightest stutter or performance dip can ruin the experience. Delivering launch day drivers will be a big difference for VR games and applications.

I think realistically we are looking at next holiday season and beyond. The next few months are crucial; if Sony continues to execute in a software-led way and proves its willingness to properly invest in a launch line-up, that will comfortably negate any hardware specification lead its opponents may have. If Valve and Oculus step up to the plate and start to show off a hand of software that rivals Sony's, though, then things get really interesting. Sony will still have a more appealing mass-market play; but great software on all platforms would be an amazing coup for VR in general, and just as a rising tide lifts all boats, that kind of competition between the VR players could truly boost the sector as a whole.

"I see a lot of media treating Oculus and Vive as having a relationship like PS/Xbox. Personally I see them as fairly different. While there is some overlap that seem, at least initially, like they are focused in different areas. While you can use each to do what the other is, they're both designed at the core quite differently and seem to me to be retrofitted to also do what the other is. For example, the Vive is focused on positional tracking right from the get-go and it is clear when you use it. Games designed for one or the other work best, IMHO, and I would offer EVE Valkyre as a great example. CCP sat down and made a game for the Oculus and the result was outstanding. It's been a real lesson in "back to basics" for development. It's like the old console days where you absolutely have to hit your frame rate. If you drop any frames you can make the user sick. Curiously, this affects some people more than others. I can instantly notice the drop of even a few frames with the headset on. Where as two of our team couldn't notice it even when it was dropping heaps. I would get sick easy, they wouldn't. Overall my greatest concern has been: can we make good VR games that people will want to play for longer than 20min?. Vive/Oculus make for great E3 demos. When people come to the studio for visits, inevitably we send them off to the VR room for a demo. It offers simple, clear, and relatable experiences that anyone can appreciate. In reality I see this as a very expensive Wii. The Wii was successful because it offered simple, fun, approachable experiences at a low cost. We don't know what kinds of games will sell well, how big the market will be, and so on. So our steps with VR are exploration and we're not banking the studio on it. I fear some studios are so swept up with the possibilities of VR they're putting everything into it when we don't know anything about the VR game market. How many people will be buying VR games? and how much will they pay?... HTC Vive price for NZ. About $1500. • /r/newzealand

f6788053-4a0c-4dcd-b34c-163d66f0fe87	VR and Mounted-Displays	How do VR systems work?	So, you have a single scene to show in two slightly different ways in the headset to give a stereoscopic effect. Does the scene have to be rendered twice? Or, is it rendered once, and the game inserts two "cameras," one for each image? Do different setting have to be applied more than once? I.e., AA/AF/HBAO etc. Is it applied once to a scene and then split between cameras, or is each scene generated, and then these run on the view of each camera? All the articles I've been reading about the large overhead for VR seem to indicate a lot is being duplicated...  
ad5db179-9ea2-41ce-99a4-96db26ed7581	VR and Mounted-Displays	Oculus Founder Defends $600 Price Tag	According to this AMA with Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus "handled the messaging poorly" when he announced the "ballpark" $350 price range for the Rift earlier this year. I like the comment he made about reselling the included Xbox controller for profit. My answer was ill-prepared, and mentally, I was contrasting $349 with $1500, not our internal estimate that hovered close to $599 - that is why I said it was in roughly the same ballpark. Later on, I tried to get across that the Rift would cost more than many expected, in the past two weeks particularly. There are a lot of reasons we did not do a better job of prepping people who already have high end GPUs, legal, financial, competitive, and otherwise, but to be perfectly honest, our biggest failing was assuming we had been clear enough about setting expectations. Another problem is that people looked at the much less advanced technology in DK2 for $350 and assumed the consumer Rift would cost a similar amount, an assumption that myself (and Oculus) did not do a good job of fixing. I apologize.  
eb8351f7-e796-408b-b85b-47df11e635a0	VR and Mounted-Displays	HTC to Vive owners: We recommend having a spotter present	Surprisingly, running around while being unable to see what's in front of you can be dangerous. HTC recommends you only use the Vive while being supervised. HTC said: "It is recommended that the product be used only while under the supervision of another person who is ready to warn of hazards that may arise while the product is being used." Click to expand... Wait, did I say running? DO NOT RUN! HTC said: "Move your feet slowly and carefully to avoid tripping, including on the cable. Make sure to maintain good footing. Tripping over the cable or contacting obstacles could cause injury" Click to expand... Now I know what you guys are thinking, "Maybe I could get a seeing eye dog to help me avoid tripping over the cable or running face first into a wall". Well, think again - HTC recommends you put Fido away while utilizing room-scale. HTC said: "Examples of hazards that could arise include, but are not limited to, tangling of a cable in a manner that presents a tripping hazard, pets entering the area where the product is being used, and the user walking too close to a wall or other hazard." Click to expand... Also, if you do happen to trip over the dog/cable/coffee table, don't go careening out the window. Or into the fireplace. Or down a flight of stairs. HTC said: "Do not rely on the product's chaperone system for protection. The headset should also not be used near stairways, large windows, heat sources, or outdoors." Click to expand... The biggest buzzkill from nanny HTC? Don't drink and Vive. HTC said: "You shouldn't use the Vive if you are under the influence of intoxicants/drugs" Click to expand... Exit question: Does requiring a spotter for room-scale solve the social isolation problem with VR?

I seriously can't wait to try it out on the consumer model. The SDE completely bleeds away, don't even notice it so I can only imagine how much better it will look on a slightly higher res screen at a higher refresh rate. I did notice an odd feeling though. During the flights, which involves whipping your ship ALLLL over the place, I felt fine. It was during the fade to black and after action report that I felt a very slight bit of nausea, nothing serious enough to require a break but it was still there. Might just be acclimation as I haven't used my DK2 in a very long time and need to reacquire my 'VR legs' but it's still something to note.
